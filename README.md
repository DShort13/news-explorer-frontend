# News Explorer

A responsive web application that allows users to search for news articles and save them to a personal collection.

## Description

News Explorer solves the problem of information overload by providing a single interface to search for news articles across various sources. Users can create an account to save articles for later reading, with all saved articles accessible from a dedicated page.
